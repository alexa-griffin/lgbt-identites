    <h1>Orientations</h1>
    <p>An Orientation (sometimes referred to as a sexual orientation, though it does not have to be sexual in nature) is what you like. This generally falls into 3 categories: romantic, sexual, and the ace/aro spectrum. Sexual and romantic attraction are self explanatory with sexual being that which one is aroused by and romantic being that which one loves, generally speaking for any *-sexual there is also a *-romantic and vice versa. The ace/aro (asexual/arosexual) specturm is the orientation lacking one or both of those.</p>
